## Open Mind

> A web application that you can use to train a machine learning model and make it recognize your images

- currently supports two class
- uses `tensorflowjs`
- supports _dataset_ upload
- can download your trained _dataset_
- similar to Google's [teachable machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) project
- An extended version of the Knn starter application

### When Using

- Try to give as much example image as possible so the application can recognize it better
- Since the training happens instantly when you add example, sometimes on lower-end devices the application might slow down for a bit

visit the demo [here](https://cluster-11.github.io/open-mind/)

### For Developer

Before creating a **pull request** or pushing code on the **master** branch, remember to do `npm run build` which will update the `/doc` folder. The demo is served from the `/doc` folder

**Note**
